🧠 Problem We’re Solving

Most students and young professionals who hit the gym regularly struggle to eat right without breaking their budget. 💸🥦

You either:

Spend too much on “healthy” meals 🍗

Or save money but fall short on nutrition ⚖️

And somehow still spend hours planning, tracking, and adjusting every week 📊⏳

There are plenty of apps that track calories or spending — but almost none that connect both worlds.
That’s where our system comes in. 🚀

🤖 What We’re Building

We’re creating an agentic system that helps users:

📂 Upload their grocery or bank data (CSV files).

🧮 Analyse how much they actually spend on food.

🥗 Generate a weekly meal plan that hits their calorie and protein goals.

💰 Stay within their set budget using real or mock store prices.

🏋️‍♂️ Get a matching training plan that aligns with their nutrition.

All of this is powered by multiple intelligent agents working together — one for spending analysis, one for nutrition, one for pricing, and one to coordinate everything.

🎯 Who It’s For

🧑‍🎓 Students and early-career professionals who train regularly.

💪 People who want affordable, high-protein meal plans.

⏰ Anyone who wants to save time and automate their diet planning.
