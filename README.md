# AI Meal Planning Playground

This repo tracks the meal-planning agent experiment described in `docs/flow`.

## Structure

- `docs/` – product notes + flow diagrams.
- `backend/` – Express + LangChain stack (see `backend/README.md` for details).
- `data/` – scratch files (placeholder).

Run backend commands from the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

More implementation notes live in `backend/README.md`.
