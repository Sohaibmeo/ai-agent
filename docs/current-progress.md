# Current Progress – Backend V2

## Open items / next steps
- Add more action coverage: change_meal_type specific tests; swap/remove ingredient tests; avoid-ingredient ranking effects.
- Enhance logging/metrics: structured counters for agent success/failure/fallback, maybe per-action audit.
- Optional: richer budget heuristics (day-level tracking) and variety constraints in selection.
- Add a Postman/testing guide in docs for comparing LLM vs fallback runs and common action flows.
