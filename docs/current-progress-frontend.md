# Next things to accomplish
- Wire recipe detail to real meal/recipe data; persist ingredient edits/add/remove and AI note via backend update endpoint.
- Swap dialog polish: real macros/prices from candidates; hook “auto decide” to backend/LLM when ready; add esc/outside-click close.
- Plans page: add history tab and stronger empty/error/toast states.
- Groceries page: “already have” toggle and price edit dialog wired to backend.
- Global polish: unit dropdown in ingredient modal, toasts for success/error, responsive tweaks.
